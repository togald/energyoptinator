# Energy-optinator
This is a framework for running energy simulations for small- and medium-sized energy systems. It can be used for larger systems, but those usually require more intricate analysis and behave more dynamically. 

## How to use
There are a couple of test cases in `energyoptinator.py`. Larger test cases are avaliable in `test.py`, including a complete simulation of an off-grid house.
